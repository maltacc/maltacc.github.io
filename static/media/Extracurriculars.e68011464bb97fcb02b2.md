Hi there! 

During my time at Waterloo I've been involved in a few clubs/labs! 

From 2022-2023, I was VP of CxC (our annual datathon), VP of Outreach, and also honorary best shark & bert impersonator. 

Since 2023, I've been an undergraduate research assistant for the Augmented Intelligence Lab under Dr. Edith Law, where I: 
- designed user workflows for a content-generation builder that allowing clients to translate the produced data into functional apps
- developed a settlement app in collaboration with Meta and the University of Waterloo for newcomers to the Kitchener-Waterloo region. We presented the app at the World Summit AI 2024!

Happy viewing! <br>
