I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Waterloo and currently a SWE intern at Microsoft Seattle on Azure Cloud Services. Previously I've worked at [Miovision](https://miovision.com/), [PointClickCare](https://pointclickcare.com/), and [BlackBerry](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy).

In my spare time, I like to:
- read up on art history
- visit museums & sketch
- hike
- kickbox
- rock climb!

And if the site wasn't a dead giveaway, I love writing and receiving emails! You can send me one at [maggieguo2138@gmail.com](mailto:maggieguo2138@gmail.com) or [maggie.guo@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:maggie.guo@uwaterloo.ca)

Best, <br> Maggie
