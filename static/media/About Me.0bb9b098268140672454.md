I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I'm also currently a SWE intern at Microsoft Seattle on Azure Cloud Services. Previously I've worked at [Miovision](https://miovision.com/), [PointClickCare](https://pointclickcare.com/), and [BlackBerry](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/automotive/blackberry-ivy).

In my spare time, I like to:
- sketch & read up on art history
- visit museums
- kickbox and practice muay thai
- rock climb!

And if the site wasn't a dead giveaway, I love writing emails!

Best, <br> Maggie
